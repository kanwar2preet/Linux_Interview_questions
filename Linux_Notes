From BIOS to Subsystems

Lets review what happens when we boot Linux:

1).The BIOS or a bootloader (lilo, zlilo, grub, etc) loads Linux Kernel from disk to memory, with some parameters defined in the bootloader
configuration. We can see this process watching the dots that appear in the screen. Kernel file stays in the /boot directory, 
and is accessed only at this moment.

2).In memory, Kernel code starts to run, detecting a series of vital devices, disk partitions etc.

3). On of the last things Kernel does is to mount the / (root) filesystem, that obrigatoriamente must 
   contain the /etc, /sbin, /bin and /lib directories.

4).Immediately behind, calls the program called init (/sbin/init) and passes the control to him.

5). The init command will read his configuration file (/etc/inittab) which defines the system runlevel, and some Shell scripts to be run.

6). These scripts will continue the setup of system's minimal infrastructure, mounting other filesystems (according to /etc/fstab), 
    activating swap space (virtual memory), etc.

7). The last step, and most interesting for you, is the execution of the special script called /etc/rc.d/rc, which 
    initializes the subsystems according to a directory structure under /etc/rc.d. The name rc comes from run commands.
