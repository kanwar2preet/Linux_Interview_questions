1) Which files stores the user min UID, max UID, password expiration settings, password encryption method being used etc.,?

ANS : /etc/login.defs


2) How do you make a file copied to a new user account automatically upon user account creation?

ANS : Store the file in /etc/skel directory.

 
3) Fields in /etc/passwd:

ANS : - UserName  Password UserID GroupID Comments HomeDir LoginShell

<Couple of lines from /etc/passwd file are pasted below for reference>

redhat:x:500:500:Redhat User:/home/redhat:/bin/bash
mssm:x:501:501:another user:/home/mssm:/bin/bash

- "x" in the password column indicates that the encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.


4) Command to lock an user account:

ANS: This can be done by using either "usermod -L <UserName>" or "passwd -l <UserName>" commands.

  Example:-
#usermod -L mango

Once an account gets locked, there would be an exclamation mark before the encrypted password files in /etc/shadow
mango:!$1$O5zV5Rj/$XhuRe8Og.AiXMXDGSIsae/:16266:0:99999:7:::

To un-lock an account:- 
#usermod -U mango


5) How to disable user login via terminals?

ANS: Add /sbin/nologin field instead of /bin/bash in /etc/passwd file.


6) Command normally recommended to edit /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files:

ANS: vipw > edit the user password file (/etc/passwd)
            vigr > edit the user group file(/etc/group)
            vipw -s > to edit shadow password file (/etc/shadow)
            vigr -s > to edit shadow group file (/etc/gshadow)

These commands would normally lock the file while editing to avoid corruption.


7) When an user tries to login via terminal, system would throw up the error "The account is currently not available" how could this be fixed? OR via GUI when he enters the password, it looks to be logging in, however, comes back to the login prompt?

ANS: This is because of the shell filed set as /sbin/nologin in /etc/passwd file, so change this back to /bin/bash and user would be able to login successfully.

If the shell filed is set as /bin/false then whenever user tries to login he would not get any error or messages, it just comes back to the prompt. Same happens in GUI mode. Can also use "system-config-users" in GUI.


8) How do you make a new user to reset his password upon his first login?

{ The prompt should come up like below }

[redhat@localhost ~]$ su - mango
Password:
You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)
Changing password for mango.
(current) UNIX password:

{ The prompt should come up like above }

ANS: Use chage command and set the expiration date as given below

[root@localhost skel]# chage -d 0 mango

<< To view password aging details >>

[root@localhost skel]# chage -l mango
Last password change : password must be changed
Password expires : password must be changed
Password inactive : password must be changed
Account expires : never
Minimum number of days between password change : 0
Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires : 7


9) Create users home directory in /home1 directory instead of default /home directory. This gets applicable to any new users who gets created i.e the home directory of that user should be /home1/<UserName>/

ANS: - Edit /etc/default/useradd
- Change the line : HOME=/home1
- Save the changes and exit. After this any new users home directory would be under /home1

- You could check the useradd defaults using the command :#useradd -D

OR

#cat /etc/default/useradd

After this you can add users with the command "useradd <UserName>". This would create the users home directory with the name of the user under the specified HOME directory as defined in /etc/default/useradd.


EXAMPLE:- adding user with "-d"

[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# useradd -d /root/doctor alldoctors
[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# grep alldoctors /etc/passwd
alldoctors:x:912:913::/root/doctor:/bin/bash
[root@Redhat5Lvm ~]# ls -ali /root/doctor/
total 28
607780 drwx------ 3 alldoctors alldoctors 4096 Aug 3 00:31 .
543457 drwxr-x--- 18 root root 4096 Aug 3 00:31 ..
608253 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 33 Aug 3 00:31 .bash_logout
608252 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 176 Aug 3 00:31 .bash_profile
608251 -rw-r--r-- 1 alldoctors alldoctors 124 Aug 3 00:31 .bashrc
608248 drwxr-xr-x 4 alldoctors alldoctors 4096 Aug 3 00:31 .mozilla


10) How do you make/grant complete access (rwx) on files created for a user and deny any level of access to others including group?

ANS : - Need to define the umask value for the required user.
- This can be done by editing .bash_profile file.

For example, if we need to define this for a user "mmurthy" then we need to edit this file "/home/mmurthy/.bash_profile" and define umask as given below (assuming that the default home directory location is not changed):

umask 0077

- Save and exit the file.
- Next time this user logs in, files/directories would get exclusive permissions only for this user as masked by umask parameter.
- For root user the umask is defined in "/etc/init.d/functions" file. Otherwise, in /etc/profile (login shell) or /etc/bashrc  (non-login shell) file.


11) How to check if an user account has been locked?

ANS:-  Run the command "passwd -S <UserName>", this would show if the password has been locked or not. Otherwise, grep for the username from /etc/shadow file and you could see "!" mark prefixed to the encrypted password field. 

[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy LK 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)

[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:!!$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::

If you notice a double exclamation mark here ("!!") this indicates that the account got locked-up by running the command "passwd -l <UserName>" command (available only for root user). Otherwise, a single exclamation mark indicates that the account got locked with the command "usermod -L <UserName>". Accounts locked with usermod command would record it in /var/log/secure file by default. 

To "unlock" an user account, run this command "passwd -u <UserName">. Otherwise, run "usermod -U <UserName" command twice to get rid off double exclamation marks in the encrypted password field. 

Otherwise, "usermod -U <UserName" would unlock an account locked by the "usermod -L <UserName>" command.

EXAMPLE:-

[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:!!$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::
 
[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy LK 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)

[root@server6 ~]# passwd -u smurthy
Unlocking password for user smurthy.
passwd: Success
 
[root@server6 ~]# grep smurthy /etc/shadow
smurthy:$6$jZqvS4ju$k.o6o7OoL7EZ1Bn52uPKeI2gqA76A7qyTl2PM8192jF2mz4ssVTz/u8DfbY2zJ7xCjFymh5FuATWxW5RxFugM1:0:0:99999:7:::
 
[root@server6 ~]# passwd -S smurthy
smurthy PS 1970-01-01 0 99999 7 -1 (Password set, SHA512 crypt.)


12) How to find out the shadow password encryption method being used in linux? How could this be changed (example : from md5 to sha512)?

 ANS:-  We can find out the password encryption method being used for shadow passwords as shown below:

- Check in /etc/login.defs
    [root@server8 ~]# grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs
    # Use SHA512 to encrypt password.
    ENCRYPT_METHOD MD5
    MD5_CRYPT_ENAB yes

OR

- Check using "authconfig" command:
    [root@server8 ~]# authconfig --test|grep hashing
    password hashing algorithm is md5

OR

- Check the password beginning character in the second field of /etc/shadow file:

If it begins with = $6 > indicates sha512
                                    $5 > sha256
                                    $1 > md5    
Examples:

ty2:$6$EyoeIHFK$L2PAXcXRo.Q5Y7zUweYkste8PtiL/CqYJ9Z/ydBvRIOqvsegpVtOU1hDfkFdUpTcmjEou4kzL/Ej5MF2HdAB7.:16378:3:100:7::16489:

ty3:$5$Bsv43yG6$/Oa4fhlKF65XW8ROohKnJaSxVIIEhUKFUEdiIcOEfY4:16378:0:99999:7:::

ty5:$1$5J4jzULD$dKGfhSIzXp50Y4mwZxcqB/:16379:0:99999:7:::

To Change Password Encryption Method to sha512:

#authconfig --passalgo=sha512 --update {this would change the password encryption method to sha512}

Verify if it got changed successfully:

[root@server8 ~]# grep -i crypt /etc/login.defs
# Use SHA512 to encrypt password.
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
MD5_CRYPT_ENAB no

[root@server8 ~]# authconfig --test|grep hashing
 password hashing algorithm is sha512 


  =======Shell Scripting Related=======


1) How to create simple shell scripts in Linux?

ANS: Make sure that the file begins with "#!/bin/bash" before any command lines. Make it executable : chmod +x <filename>. Executed by running "sh <filename.sh>" OR <./filename.sh>".


2) Which command to be used to check the shell being used?

ANS: echo $SHELL



  =======Log File Related=======


1) Where are the log files stored usually in linux?

ANS: under /var/log

 
2) How to check if the syslog service is running in RHEL6?

ANS: /etc/init.d/rsyslog status OR service rsyslog status

 
3) By default log files are set to get rotated on weekly basis, how to make this gets rotated on monthly basis?

ANS: Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and change below lines

# rotate log files monthly
monthly

Save changes and if you want to rotate the log files immediately then run the command:

#logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf

 
4) How do you check the boot messages (kernel ring buffer)?

ANS: Using "dmesg" or #cat /var/log/dmesg



  =======Package/Yum Related=======


1) What does 'ivh' represents in rpm -ivh <PackageName> command?

ANS: i - install
v - verbose mode
h - hash mode where it would print ## characters as the installation progresses

 
2) What is the difference between rpm -F <PackageName> and rpm -U <PackageName>?

ANS: rpm -F = Basically freshens a package which in turn upgrades an existing package, otherwise doesn't install it if an earlier version not found.
rpm -U = Upgrades an existing package if exists otherwise install it.

 
3) How to find to which package the "ls" commands belongs to (to find out package responsible for this command)?

ANS : #rpm -qf /bin/ls {this would tell about the package to which this command belongs to}


4) How to find out the configuration files installed by a package (take into consideration of the "coreutils" package)?

ANS : # rpm -qc coreutils

To list out only the document files installed by coreutils package:-
# rpm -qd coreutils 

To list out all the files installed by this package:-
# rpm -ql coreutils 
OR
#rpm -q --filesbypkg coreutils


To list out the dependent packages:-
# rpm -qR coreutils

To find out more information of this package:-
#rpm -qi coreutils


5) How do you find out all the packages installed on a RHEL system(server)? 

ANS : - /root/install.log > this would only lists packages installed during deployment of the system. Packages installed later would not be listed here.
- Otherwise, run the command #rpm -qa > this would query all packages and prints out names respectively.

- In RHEL 5 we can check the file : /var/log/rpmpkgs to find out all packages on the system. However, this file is deprecated in RHEL6.

- Note: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the daily cron file to create /var/log/rpmpkgs is provided by the rpm-cron package, available in the optional repository, not the main 'rpm' package. So, if you do not install the package, /var/log/rpmpkgs is not available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. (Ref - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/23743)

- In RHEL 6 > yumdb info | grep -v ^\ | grep -v '^$' | sort > /root/yumdblist.out (grep -v '^$' > this deletes empty lines). The file "/root/yumdblist.out" would provide with all the packages installed on the system.


6) How to create a local yum repository which would make use of the mounted linux ISO image under /media ?

ANS : Create files ending with .repo extension under /etc/yum.repos.d directory with proper syntax:

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# cat local.repo
[local]
name=RHEL6.5
baseurl=file:///media
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///media/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release


7) Different ways that can be used to verify that a package got installed successfully via yum:

ANS : ==Method 1==

- Immediately after running yum command, check exit status, if it shows "0" (numeral) then command executed successfully.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# echo $?
0

==Method 2==
- Run rpm -qa and test.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# rpm -qa | grep certmonger
certmonger-0.61-3.el6.x86_64

==Method 3==
- Verify with rpm command:

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# rpm -V certmonger

==Method 4==
- Check the yum log to see the successful log entry about the same package.

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# grep certmonger /var/log/yum.log
Jul 15 10:33:22 Installed: certmonger-0.61-3.el6.x86_64 


8)How to view the installed date of a package (consider the package sg3_utils)? 
wq
ANS:- Check in /var/log/yum.log file (provided the package is installed by yum):- 

[root@server8 ~]# grep sg3_utils /var/log/yum.log
Oct 22 12:11:38 Installed: sg3_utils-1.28-4.el6.x86_64

OR

Use the command "rpm -q <PackageName> --last" 

 [root@server8 ~]# rpm -q sg3_utils --last
sg3_utils-1.28-4.el6.x86_64                   Wed 22 Oct 2014 12:11:37 PM PDT

OR

Using the "rpm -qi <PackageName> | grep "Install Date" command

[root@server8 ~]# rpm -qi sg3_utils|grep "Install Date"
Install Date: Wed 22 Oct 2014 12:11:37 PM PDT      Build Host: x86-004.build.bos.redhat.com

In RHEL 5.x, one could use /var/log/rpmpkgs file to check this. To get a list of all the packages installed date: #rpm -qa --last



  =======File System/LVM Related=======


1) How to check what file systems are mounted and their read/write status?

ANS : #cat /etc/mtab
#cat /proc/mounts
#mount
#df -Th > this would not tell the read/write status


2) Where is grub.conf file stored in RHEL6/RHEL5 systems?

ANS : In /boot/grub/ directory.


3) How do you remount a file system read only on the fly?

ANS : #mount -o remount,ro <Mountpoint>
- To make a file system gets mounted read only during boot ,need to edit fstab.


4) Command used to convert ext2 file system into ext3.

ANS : tune2fs -j <device or file system name>


5) How to run file system check on a logical volume in rescue mode?

ANS : - Boot into rescue mode ("linux rescue nomount")
- Don't mount any file systems, so "Skip" mounting.
- First make the logical volumes available by running these commands:
- lvm pvscan
- lvm vgscan
- lvm lvscan
- lvm lvchange -ay
- Next, run the file system check on the respective lvm.
- #e2fsck -fy /dev/vgname/lvname


6) How to reduce/extend a root lvm?

ANS : To Reduce - boot into rescue mode without mounting file system (linux rescue nomount).
- activate the lvms if required as explained in previous answer.
- run file system check on respective lvm.
- reduce file system : #resize2fs /dev/vg1/rootlv 5G
- Next, reduce the corresponding lvm : #lvreduce -L 5G /dev/vg1/rootlv (reducing the LV to 5GB)
- Run fsck again.
- Verify the lvm is reflecting the correct size.

To extend - no need to boot into rescue, this could be done online.
- unmount the respective file system first (this is not absolutely necessary, size can be extended online, but always recommended to unmount respective file system)
- Extend the lv : #lvextend -L +1G /dev/vg1/rootlv (extending the size to 1GB plus)
- Extend the file system : #resize2fs /dev/vg1/rootlv
- Run fsck if necessary.


7) How to verify if the filesystem state is marked as clean by fsck/e2fsck or by kernel?

ANS : [root@redhat Desktop]# dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda1 |grep -i state
dumpe2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Filesystem state: clean

OR

[root@server8 Desktop]# tune2fs -l /dev/sda1|grep -i state
Filesystem state:         clean


8) How to find out backup superblocks for a logical volume?

Backup superblock at 884736, Group descriptors at 884737-884737

                       OR
If the file system is un-mounted then could use mke2fs : #mke2fs -n /dev/vg1/rootlv | grep -i -A1 "superblock backup"


9) Find out list of actual devices associated with a logical volume using lvs command?

ANS : [root@redhat Desktop]# lvs -o +segtype,devices

LV VG Attr LSize Pool Origin Data% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert Type Devices
homelv vg1 -wi-ao---- 1000.00m linear /dev/sda2(0)

--- Physical volumes ---
PV Name /dev/sdb
PV UUID nFwUZd-F4Cm-tbeq-y75d-OUzX-S2ze-rEeR8x
PV Status allocatable
Total PE / Free PE 25 / 0

PV Name /dev/sdc
PV UUID KWfeHu-cP6u-Qpdz-XzDD-iomY-uSKd-2d6V6G
PV Status allocatable
Total PE / Free PE 25 / 24

OR

- Check the latest lvm archive under /etc/lvm/archive/<archivename>:
[root@redhat Desktop]# grep device /etc/lvm/archive/vg2_00003-697546303.vg
device = "/dev/sdb" # Hint only
device = "/dev/sdc" # Hint only


10) How to set "rw" permissions on file for a user and disable for other users except root user (exclusive permissions)? 

ANS : Use "setfacl -m u:<UserName>:<PermissionBits> <File/FolderPath>

 #setfacl -m u:redhat:rw /testfile {redhat is an user here}. 

To read use "getfacl" command: #getfacl /testfile


11) Different fields in /etc/fstab.

ANS : - DeviceName      MountPoint     FilesystemType     MountOptions DumpFrequency     FsckCheckOrder
 
     
12) How do you skip the initial fsck(file system check) on a file system while booting up? 

 ANS : - Edit /etc/fstab and make the last column of the respective file system as 0 (number). This would skip the file system check process.


13) How to list all the files with SUID (Set User ID) bit set under the top level root directory and ignore any errors/warnings in the process, and list the output in long list format? 

ANS:- find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l


14) How to list all the files/folders with SUID/SGID/Sticky Bit (Set Group ID) bit set under the top level root directory and ignore any errors/warnings in the process, and list the output in long list format?

ANS:- find / -type f -perm /7000 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l



  =======Boot/Kernel Related=======


1) I've installed the latest kernel on the system successfully, however, my server still boots from the old kernel. How do you make the system to boot from the newly installed kernel?

ANS : - Verify if the new kernel packages are installed successfully.
- Verify if the kernel stanza is added in grub.conf file.
- Make the new kernel as the default kernel to boot in grub.conf file. Either move the kernel stanza to be the first or change "default" entry according to the  kernel stanza to boot.


2) There is an error during the boot stating "cannot resolve label for a file system" and system is dropping into single user mode. System would show up  Ctrl+D error. How could this be fixed?

ANS : - Make a note of the file system for which the label failed to resolve.
- Boot into single user mode.
- remount root file system in rw mode = #mount -o remount,rw /
- use "blkid" or "e2label" or "findfs" or "lsblk -f" OR "check in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ or /dev/disk/by-label/" to find out the labels/UUIDs assigned to each mounted devices. If the label is not correct in fstab then edit it.
- Exit and reboot. this would fix the label error.


3) Which command is to be used to create GRUB password to avoid normal user in editing GRUB interface while booting?

ANS :Using the command "grub-crypt" (in RHEL 6.x). This generates an encrypted password using "sha512" algorithm. You could also use "grub-md5-crypt" which generates "md5" encrypted password.

- paste the generated encrypted password into grub.conf file wherever needed as shown below (only a part of grub.conf file is pasted below):

default=0
timeout=5
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
hiddenmenu
password --encrypted $1$EgrNz1$MbdclVToRCCsOF7OuBEgb/
title Red Hat Enterprise Linux (2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64)

So, with the grub password added anyone who wants to pass arguments to kernel while booting has to enter the password by pressing "P" and then proceed. RHEL 5.x, uses "grub-md5-crypt" command by default to generate one.


4) How do you disable the "NetworkManager" service on runlevel 5?

ANS : [root@redhat Desktop]# chkconfig --level 5 NetworkManager off

[root@redhat Desktop]# chkconfig --list NetworkManager
NetworkManager 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:off 6:off


5) Which is the parameter that you would add to grub.conf while configuring kdump?

ANS : crashkernel=128M (for 128MB crash memory) {crashkernel=0M-2G:128M,2G-6G:256M,6G-8G:512M,8G-:768M}

4) The option "Open in Terminal" is missing when user right clicks on terminal in GUI. How to fix this? 

ANS : This is basically because of missing package "nautilus-open-terminal". Once this is installed, the right click option would show up. 


5) How to change the default display manager or desktop from Gnome Display Manager (gdm) to kde?

ANS: You would need to install the KDE related packages first. Run command "yum groupinstall "KDE Desktop" to get all the KDE related packages to be installed (provided yum is configured). Once this is done, create the file "/etc/sysconfig/desktop" and add the below lines:

DISPLAYMANAGER="KDE"
DESKTOP="KDE" 

 After this change, restart the X window session.

In RHEL 5.x, you could use "switchdesk" command to switch to different display managers. So, to switch to KDE, you could use the command "switchdesk kde". This may prompt to install "KDE Software Development" group if not installed.  



  =======Networking Related=======


1) How do you change the network speed of an interface to 100Mbps with auto-negotiation off and duplex in full mode(example for interface eth0)?

ANS : - #ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 autoneg off duplex full {changing the speed on the fly}
- To make this changes persistent need to add the below line to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file:
ETHTOOL_OPTS="speed 100 autoneg off duplex full"


2) Every time the system reboots the network interface doesn't come up. However, if you restart network service or execute "ifup eth0" command which would bring up the network fine? How could this be fixed?

ANS : Make sure that "ONBOOT=Yes" is set in the respective configuration file (example in ifcfg-eth0 for eth0). In this case the "ONBOOT" parameter would be set to "NO".

- If the above step doesn't help then check /etc/sysconfig/network file and make sure "NETWORKING" is set to "Yes". {These are the most likely reasons in this case}


3) How do you check the network routing table using commands?

ANS : -  #route -n
OR
#netstat -nr

4) After changing the network card on a system the network interface name got changed from eth0 to eth1. This shows when you run the command "ifconfig -a". Running "service network restart", shows this error "Device eth0 doesn't seem to be present". But when you run the command "ifconfig -a" you would notice eth1 is listed there instead of eth0. So, running "ifup eth1" shows error as "configuration for eth1 not found". How to make sure that the network interface becomes eth0 here and up along with the server?

ANS : - Make a note of the HW/MAC address of the second network interface here. {ifconfig eth1}
- Enter this MAC into the field "HWADDR" in ifcfg-eth0 file.
- Now, edit "/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file.
- You comment out the line of eth0 here and change the name of eth1 to eth0. Save and exit.
- Reboot the system. {this should fix the issue, tested on RHEL6.5 system}



  =======Security Related=======


1) How do you backup and restore iptables (configurations)?

ANS : #iptables-save > /tmp/iptables.out
#iptables-restore < /tmp/iptables.out


2) What does the character "S" or "s" in the execute bit location of user permission indicates?
 
ANS : # "S" indicates that the SUID has been set, however, execute permission is not set. "s" indicates SUID has been set with execute permission.


3) How do you provide an user exclusive permissions to shutdown or reboot a system?

ANS : # Make the user sudo with appropriate permissions on the commands required.
- Edit the file /etc/sudoers using the command "visudo".
- Add the below lines to /etc/sudoers file: (example to make user "raj" to execute shutdown/reboot commands)

{format
   <username>                             <host>=<commands>  }

raj      ALL=/sbin/shutdown,/sbin/reboot,/sbin/poweroff

- The next user logins and executes the command "sudo /sbin/shutdown" the user would be prompted to enter password and upon successful authentication the command gets executed.


4) How to disable password-less login for root user in single user mode? 

ANS:- Change the line that reads "SINGLE=/sbin/sushell" to "SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin" in "/etc/sysconfig/init" file. 

This prompts for user (root) to enter a valid password to authenticate.  


       
5) How to temporarily disable all user log-in except root user (either via SSH or terminal or in GUI)?

ANS:- This could be achieved by creating /etc/nologin file (as root user). If this file exists then any user who tries to log-in would gets rejected and only root user would be allowed (the root user may not be allowed to login via ssh if "PermitRootLogin" is set to "no" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config).


6) How to disable "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI Login screen? 

 ANS: In RHEL 6.x, you would need to use gconftool-2 or gconf-editor commands for this purpose. 

Using gconftool-2 command:

To disable "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI log-in screen, run the below command as root user:

#gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults --type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_restart_buttons true

These are defined as schemas in "/etc/gconf/schemas/gdm-simple-greeter.schemas" file. 

Same way, if you wish to disable user list, run the below command as root user:

#gconftool-2 --direct --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defautls --type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true


Using gconf-editor command:

Run "gconf-editor" command, expand "apps" and then "gdm", click on "simple-greeter" and then check "disable_restart_buttons", then right click on "disable_restart_buttons" and choose "Set as Default". 

In RHEL 5.x

The simplest way to achieve this in RHEL 5.x is to run the command "gdmsetup" in GUI as root user, un-check "Show Actions Menu" under "Menu Bar" in "local" tab. This would remove "Restart" & "Shut Down" buttons on the GUI log-in screen.

In RHEL 7.x 

Edit (as root user) "/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-custom-gdm-settings" file and the following lines:

[org/gnome/login-screen]
disable-user-list=true

Then update "dconf" database using the command "dconf update", finally restart gdm service "systemctl restart gdm"


7) What does the umask value of 0022 indicates for a root user? 

 ANS:Before understanding this, one must understand the numerical values being used to represent permission bits in Unix environment. It is as shown below:

      r - "read" permission - numerical equivalent value "4"
      w - "write" permission - numerical equivalent value "2"
      x - "execute" permission - numerical equivalent value "1"
      s - "special" permission bit - numerical equivalent "4" for SUID (SetUserID), "2" for SGID(SetGroupID "1" for Sticky-bit.
   
      u - "user"  
      g - "group" 
      o - "others"       
     
      Set/Unset Permissions: Using chmod command. Say for example you wish to set only "read & write (rw)" permission for owner, no permissions for group and others then this could be done like below:
     
      $chmod 600 <filename> OR $chmod u+rw,go-rwx <filename>
     
     
Now, lets check what does 0022 umask value indicates:
   
      0 - Indicates special character bit, not masked.
      0 - Indicates mask nothing, all permission bits are set for "Owner".
      2 - Indicates mask 2 for "Group" (for files it is "x4x" meaning both read & write bits are set likewise for directories it is "x5x" meaning both read & execute bits are set)
      2 - Indicates mask 2 for others ( as explained above)
     
               Saying so, when a root user creates a file/directory this umask bit would be used to set the effective permissions. For a file it would be (666-022=644), rw-,r--,r-- (read&write,read,read) respectively for user, group and others (ugo). However, when a directory is created it would be (777-022=755) rwx,r-x,r-x for ugo. Same way the default umask value for other users is 0002.
